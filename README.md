# UnderROT #

**UnderROT** is the framework for a simple real-time graphical roguelike game, currently dubbed **"Against the Ooze."**

It is an implementation of [rot.js: ROguelike Toolkit in JavaScript](http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/), with significant credit to the [CodingCookies.com: Building a Roguelike in Javascript](http://www.codingcookies.com/2013/04/01/building-a-roguelike-in-javascript-part-1/) tutorial series. These are excellent resources, and any painfully amateur code contained herein is likely an addition of mine.

UnderROT and "Against the Ooze" ~~are currently under development. (At a slow pace.) (With a long way to go.)~~ development is currently on hiatus. (With full intent to resume.)
